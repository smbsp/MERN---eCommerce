/**

   NativeModule
    Definition: A NativeModule in Node.js is a built-in module written in C/C++ and embedded directly in the Node.js binary.
    Purpose: Provides core functionalities efficiently through the V8 engine, such as fs, http, and others.
    Usage: JavaScript code can directly require these modules since they are built into Node.js itself.


   Internal Binding
    Definition: Internal bindings are C/C++ code bindings within Node.js that expose low-level system functionalities to JavaScript.
    Purpose: Provide a bridge between native code and JavaScript, enabling the implementation of Node.jsâ€™s built-in modules.
    Usage: JavaScript modules use these internal bindings to access low-level features like file systems, networking, and more.
